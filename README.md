# About

Common LIMS is a framework for building custom LIMS systems for labs. It's built using Python and Django in the backend and Javascript (React) in the frontend. Workflows are defined using BPMN notation and executed through the Camunda workflow engine.

The system is designed to be highly extensible, allowing different sites to share their domain knowledge through plugins. These plugins include both UI components and executable code as well as domain specific objects and workflows.

More details are available in the document docs/development.md.
