domain:
    Contains all domain objects. Users of this module (extension writers) generally
    interact only with these objects and never with REST endpoints directly.

repository:
    Repository classes provide access to the underlying REST API and map from those resources
    to the easier to use domain objects. These classes should do no special grouping or other
    business logic, leave that to the service classes

service:
    Service classes use the repository and do some extra business logic on those. They might for example
    group all artifacts into analytes.
